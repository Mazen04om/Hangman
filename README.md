Hangman Game
This is a Python-based Hangman game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. The game allows users to guess letters in an attempt to figure out a randomly chosen word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before losing.



Features:
Graphical Interface: The game has an easy-to-use GUI, displaying the hangman and the word being guessed.
Word Input: Users can input guesses via the text entry box or by clicking on the provided letter buttons.
Multiple Attempts: Players have 6 attempts to guess the correct word before losing.
Word Display: The word being guessed is displayed with underscores for unguessed letters.



How to Play:
Start the game by opening the .py file.
Guess letters by typing them in the entry box and pressing "Enter" or clicking the "Guess" button.
If the letter is correct, it will be displayed in the word.
If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman will be drawn, and you will lose one attempt.
You win if you guess the word before running out of attempts. If you fail, the full hangman will be drawn, and the game will display the correct word.
